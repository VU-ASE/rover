**The `rover` repository is the heart and soul of everything ASE. The various software components bundled here allow for pipeline execution, service development and remote control of the Rovers we offer. All software is always bundled and released in parallel, so you can always rest assured that versions are perfectly compatible. Some parts of this codebase are based on standardized specifications, such as an OpenAPI spec, and JSON schema.**
